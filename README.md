For each record it is provided:
==========================================================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 86-feature vector recorded as an average per activity and subject.
- Its activity label and activity ID. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
